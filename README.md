For some analyses, e.g. the sparsity analysis by epoch, train the corresponding network (full precision/no quantization; choose to log a snapshot of the network every epoch). This generates several 10s of GBs of data, hence we prefer not to share them unless necessary. ### Structure##### Algorithm evaluationsImplementation:|  filename  |  content ||---|---|| dataCollect.py | functions to 1) load the models, 2) obtain the feature maps within a model, 3) read data from tensorboard log files || referenceImpl.py | implementations of the baseline compression algorithms (CSC, zeroRLE, ZVC) || bpcUtils.py | contains the implementation of the compressor incl. all its building blocks as well as the quantization function and the value-to-binary conversion || analysisTools.py | provides the Analyzer class which is instantiated for a specific default quantization method and compressor. It provides functions to get properties such as the compression ratio for a given feature map tensor, its sparsity, ... || groupedBarPlot.py | utility function: creates nice grouped bar plots based on PyPlot || reporting.py | contains functions to read, write, and parse CSV files |Analyses and visualizations: |  filename  |  content ||---|---|| totalComprRatio_generate.py  | script to generate/collect all the statistics for the total compression ratio figure; writes results to file; long run-timescript to generate/collect all the statistics for the total compression ratio figure; writes results to file; long run-time || totalComprRatio_plot.ipynb  | visualizes all the results on the total compression ratio || sparsityByEpoch.ipynb  | generates the figure as suggested by the filename || sparsityBoxplot.ipynb  | generates the figure as suggested by the filename || histogram.ipynb  | generates the figure as suggested by the filename |##### Hardware implementation(TBD)### LicensingPlease refer to the LICENSE file for the licensing of the algorithm evaluation code and to the LICENSE_HARDWARE file for the licensing of the files related to the hardware implementation.
